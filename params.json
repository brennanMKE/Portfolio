{"name":"My Portfolio on GitHib","tagline":"Brennan Stehling of SmallSharpTools LLC","body":"My name is [Brennan Stehling](http://www.linkedin.com/in/smallsharptools/) and I have been developing software since I was in grade school. \r\nMost recently I have been doing iOS development. In the past couple of years I have worked on the following\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n* [Marquette University](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marquette-university/id530216413?mt=8) \r\n* [SonicMax Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicmax-pro/id478366186?mt=8)\r\n\r\nThe music app was featured at CES as a part of the [JVC version](http://sonicmax.jvc.com/) which \r\nintegrates with their car stereo, docks and headsets. \r\nYou can see [a video of the app on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQXp5PGolRg).\r\nI have also worked on other iOS projects for \r\nuse privately as a business tool which are not in the App Store.\r\n\r\nI've also published resources and sample projects I've created on GitHub, such as the following:\r\n\r\n1. [Xcode snippets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Xcode4CodeSnippets) - various snippets I use all the time\r\n2. [Optimized Networking](https://github.com/brennanMKE/OptimizedNetworking) - code I used to learn to use NSOperation and now use regularly\r\n3. [Photo Zoom](https://github.com/brennanMKE/PhotoZoom) - Sample Project which I use in multiple projects now\r\n4. [Interfaces](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Interfaces) - Experiments with iOS interfaces like the SideBar UI and more to come\r\n5. [Multiple Targets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/MultipleTargets) - Sample Project with a list of steps to build multiple versions of apps from a single project\r\n\r\nI find that Open Source helps me share what I have learned and allow others to share feedback with me on my work. \r\nIt comes in especially handy when I am using \r\n[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10366/brennan) when I can directly \r\nlink to one of my GitHub projects so others can see the code and access it easily.\r\n\r\nI can be found on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/smallsharptools/) and\r\non Twitter as @[brennanMKE](https://twitter.com/brennanMKE) \r\nor my company account @[smallsharptools](https://twitter.com/smallsharptools). \r\nI also have an account on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/smallsharptools).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
