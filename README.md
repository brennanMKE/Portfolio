My name is Brennan Stehling and I have been developing software since I was in grade school. 
Most recently I have been doing iOS development. This work includes an app for 
[Marquette University](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marquette-university/id530216413?mt=8) 
and a music app called [SonicMax Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicmax-pro/id478366186?mt=8). 
The music app was featured at CES as a part of the [JVC version](http://sonicmax.jvc.com/) which 
integrates with their car stereo and headsets.

I've also published several R&D projects here on GitHub, such as the following:

1. [Xcode snippets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Xcode4CodeSnippets) - various snippets I use all the time
2. [Optimized Networking](https://github.com/brennanMKE/OptimizedNetworking) - code I used to learn to use NSOperation and now use regularly
3. [Photo Zoom](https://github.com/brennanMKE/PhotoZoom) - Sample Project which I use in multiple projects now
4. [Multiple Targets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/MultipleTargets) - Sample Project with a list of steps to build multiple versions of apps from a single project

Some of code that I share publicly is included in my client projects. I find that Open Source helps me 
share what I have learned and allow others to share feedback with me on my work. It comes in especially 
handy when I am using [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10366/brennan) when I can directly 
link to one of my GitHub projects so others can see the code and access it easily.

I can be found on Twitter as @[brennanMKE](https://twitter.com/brennanMKE)

I also have an account on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/smallsharptools).
