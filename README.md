My name is Brennan Stehling and I have been developing software since I was in grade school. 
Most recently I have been doing iOS development. In the past couple of years I have worked on the following
projects.

* [Marquette University](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marquette-university/id530216413?mt=8) 
* [SonicMax Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicmax-pro/id478366186?mt=8)

The music app was featured at CES as a part of the [JVC version](http://sonicmax.jvc.com/) which 
integrates with their car stereo, docks and headsets. 
You can see [a video of the app on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQXp5PGolRg).
I have also worked on other iOS projects for 
use privately as a business tool which are not in the App Store.

I've also published resources and sample projects I've created on GitHub, such as the following:

1. [Xcode snippets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Xcode4CodeSnippets) - various snippets I use all the time
2. [Optimized Networking](https://github.com/brennanMKE/OptimizedNetworking) - code I used to learn to use NSOperation and now use regularly
3. [Photo Zoom](https://github.com/brennanMKE/PhotoZoom) - Sample Project which I use in multiple projects now
4. [Interfaces](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Interfaces) - Experiments with iOS interfaces like the SideBar UI and more to come
5. [Multiple Targets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/MultipleTargets) - Sample Project with a list of steps to build multiple versions of apps from a single project

I find that Open Source helps me share what I have learned and allow others to share feedback with me on my work. 
It comes in especially handy when I am using 
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10366/brennan) when I can directly 
link to one of my GitHub projects so others can see the code and access it easily.

I also have an account on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/smallsharptools).
