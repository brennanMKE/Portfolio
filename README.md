Portfolio
=========

My name is [Brennan Stehling](http://www.linkedin.com/in/smallsharptools/) and I have been doing software development for
many years from Perl to Java to .NET and now iOS. The 2 most recent projects which are publicly available in the
App Store include the following.

* [Marquette University](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marquette-university/id530216413?mt=8) 
* [SonicMax Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicmax-pro/id478366186?mt=8)

The app built for Marquette is meant to be a primary app which acts as a hub for the other apps which will be created
for niche purposes for the Marquette student, staff and alumni communities. It is very visual to leverage the many
great photos available from Marquette as well as the great screen on the iPhone. Users can use the map to find places
on campus and search contacts for staff so users can reach them by phone or email.

SonicMax Pro processes audio in realtime and was featured at CES as a part of the [JVC version](http://sonicmax.jvc.com/) 
which  integrates with their car stereo, docks and headsets. 
You can see [a video of the app on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQXp5PGolRg).
I have also worked on other iOS projects for 
use privately as business tools which are not in the App Store.

I've also published resources and sample projects I've created on GitHub, such as the following:

1. [Xcode snippets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Xcode4CodeSnippets) - various snippets I use all the time
2. [Optimized Networking](https://github.com/brennanMKE/OptimizedNetworking) - code I used to learn to use NSOperation and now use regularly
3. [Photo Zoom](https://github.com/brennanMKE/PhotoZoom) - Sample Project which I use in multiple projects now
4. [Interfaces](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Interfaces) - Experiments with iOS interfaces like the SideBar UI and more to come
5. [Multiple Targets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/MultipleTargets) - Sample Project with a list of steps to build multiple versions of apps from a single project

I find that Open Source helps me share what I have learned and allow others to share feedback with me on my work. 
It comes in especially handy when I am using 
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10366/brennan) when I can directly 
link to one of my GitHub projects so others can see the code and access it easily.
