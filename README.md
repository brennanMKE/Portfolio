My name is Brennan Stehling and I have been developing software since I was in grade school. Most recently I have been doing iOS development. This work includes an app for [Marquette University](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marquette-university/id530216413?mt=8) and a music app called [SonicMax Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicmax-pro/id478366186?mt=8). The music app was featured at CES as a part of the [JVC version](http://sonicmax.jvc.com/) which integrates with their car stereo and headsets.

I've also published several R&D projects here on GitHub, such as my [Xcode snippets](https://github.com/brennanMKE/Xcode4CodeSnippets), [Optimized Networking](https://github.com/brennanMKE/OptimizedNetworking) and [Photo Zoom](https://github.com/brennanMKE/PhotoZoom) projects to just mention a few.

Some of code that I share publicly is included in my client projects. I find that Open Source helps me share what I have learned and allow others to share feedback with me on my work. It comes in especially handy when I am using [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/10366/brennan) when I can directly link to one of my GitHub projects so others can see the code and access it easily.

I can be found on Twitter as @[brennanMKE](https://twitter.com/brennanMKE) or my company account @[smallsharptools](https://twitter.com/smallsharptools). I also have an account on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/smallsharptools).
